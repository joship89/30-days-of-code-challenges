# Currency Exchange Rate Moving Averages Tracker

- Moving Average Convergence Divergence is a technical indicator developed by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s. It is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a time series.

- This app tracks moving averages of currency conversion rates to detect strong trend changes and momentum indicators.

- The idea is to track the relationship between moving averages of the currency conversion rates for time periods of 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. 

- As the shorter term moving average diverges further from the longer term moving average it indicates that the upside momentum is increasing. Divergence signals the end of momentum or current trend. 


## Usage

## Notes

- The app will be extended in the future to include conversion rates for other currencies.
- Email notifications upon convergence and divergence of moving averages will be tested.
