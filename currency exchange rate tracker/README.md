# Currency Exchange Rate Moving Averages Tracker

- Moving Average Convergence Divergence is a technical indicator developed by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s. It is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a time series.

- This app tracks moving averages of currency conversion rates to detect strong trend changes and momentum indicators.

- The idea is to track the relationship between three moving averages of the currency conversion rates. Moving averages for time periods of 30 days, 60 days and 90 days are tracked here. 

- While convergence of shorter term and longer term moving averages signals momentum of current conversion rates, divergence signals end of momentum or current trend.

- As the shorter term moving average diverges further from the longer term moving average it indicates that the upside momentum is increasing. As the shorter term moving average diverges further below the longer term moving average, it means that the downside momentum is increasing.
